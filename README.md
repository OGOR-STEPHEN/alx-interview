Pascal's Triangle

Pascals triangle or Pascal's triangle is an arrangement of binomial coefficients in triangular form. It is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal. The numbers in Pascal's triangle are placed in such a way that each number is the sum of two numbers just above the number. Pascals triangle is used widely in probability theory, combinatorics, and algebra.

What Are Python Algorithms?

Python algorithms provide a detailed set of instructions by which you can process data for a specific purpose. The most well-known are sorting and graph.

Python algorithms are indispensable tools for any software engineer or data scientist. Algorithms are not language-specific and have no standardized rules dictating how they should be written. This means that solutions weâ€™ve used for decades can be applied as needed to a Python program. There are several types of algorithms that are useful in Python.
